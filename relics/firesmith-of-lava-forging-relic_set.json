One day, at the bottom of a volcano, Foy found a deposit of rare obsidian flame crystal. From this, he carefully polished a pair of protective goggles, which transformed the fierce sparks of fire into pale-white silhouettes. However, the greedy smith was unable to fully escape his cursed fate either, burning everything he was into cinders in the ultimate fire.Foy deemed the Antimatter Legion in the Warforge as the raw materials for his creations, and himself as the rising flame.\"I wonder... is it possible to harness the power of a thermonuclear reaction in my furnace?\" Foy's pursuit of the ultimate fire came to an unfruitful end in an out-of-control thermonuclear fusion.","slot":"Head"},{"name":"Firesmith's Ring of Flame-Mastery","story":"A 900-degree kiln can turn clay into ceramic, a 1000-degree furnace can melt tin and copper...

Neither the bubbling of toxic gases nor the gurgling of magma could interrupt Surtur's concentration at the forge. Though burning waves of molten rock would splash on Surtur's fireproof apron of giant firelizard skin, the leather never lost its luster when the flames faded.A massive proportion of the Legion's fighting forces were repeatedly hammered and smelted in the forge until their flesh and weaponry were fused together under the hammers of the Firesmiths, becoming weapons of Destruction.\"This incomparable power of destruction...\" The Firesmiths who control the flames have never hidden the terrible aspirations they place in their weapons.","slot":"Body"},{"name":"Firesmith's Alloy Leg","story":"In the old days, the prison masters feared losing the extraordinary arts of Firesmithing, so they would employ the most despicable tricks to incarcerate the Firesmith clan — all the chiefs of the Firesmiths would undoubtedly suffer deformities in the legs in those days of imprisonment.It was the Master of Destruction that set free the imprisoned Firesmith clan and bestowed upon them the mark of Destruction which in turn granted the Firesmiths unlimited power.Despite the inability to move around like an able-bodied man, the chief of Firesmith obtained true freedom, for he was no longer imprisoned just for his extraordinary skills and talents in the art of Firesmithing.
